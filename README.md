# My dotfiles

This repo hosts my dotfiles. I manage them using
[this tool](https://github.com/kwalter94/dotrepo) that I started writing
whilst I was learning [this](https://crystal-lang.org) awesome language.
The tool is basically a poor man's [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).
I do recommend Stow over it for
[managing dotfiles](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html).
